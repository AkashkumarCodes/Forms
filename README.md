## HTML Pages


## Login Page

The Login Page is an essential component of our application, designed to provide users with a secure and straightforward way to access their accounts. It serves the following key purposes:

- **User Authentication:** The Login Page acts as a gateway to access user accounts. It requires users to provide their registered email and password to log in.

- **Access Control:** By validating user credentials, the Login Page ensures that only authorized individuals can access their accounts, enhancing security and protecting user data.

- **Personalized Experience:** Once logged in, users gain access to personalized features, such as user profiles, dashboards, or exclusive content.

- **User-Friendly Experience:** We've designed the Login Page to be user-friendly, making it easy for users to input their login credentials and initiate the login process.

With this Login Page, we aim to provide a secure and efficient means for users to access their accounts while maintaining a positive user experience.





## Registration Page

The Registration Page serves as a fundamental component of our application, designed to facilitate the onboarding of new users. Its primary objectives are as follows:

- **User Onboarding:** The Registration Page provides a platform for new users to create accounts and join our platform. It enables users to establish their presence within our system.

- **User Data Collection:** New users can input essential information, including their name, age, email, date of birth, contact number, and profile image. This data is crucial for creating personalized user profiles and enhancing the user experience.

- **Account Creation:** Once users submit their information, the Registration Page processes the data and creates new user accounts within our system. This step is a crucial element in our user management process.

- **Data Validation:** The Registration Page incorporates data validation and error handling to ensure that user-submitted information is accurate and complete. This is essential for maintaining data integrity.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** We've designed the Registration Page to offer a user-friendly and intuitive experience, making it easy for new users to create their accounts with minimal effort.

The Registration Page plays a pivotal role in expanding our user base and collecting the information needed for delivering a tailored and enjoyable experience to our users.




## PHP Scripts

### User Registration Script

The User Registration Script is a critical component of our application, designed to facilitate the registration of new users. Its main objectives include:

- **Database Interaction:** The User Registration Script establishes a connection to our database and manages the insertion of user data. This is a crucial step in creating user accounts and maintaining our user database.

- **User Data Processing:** The script processes user data submitted through the registration form, including name, age, email, date of birth, contact number, and profile image. This information is then prepared for insertion into the database.

- **Data Validation:** To ensure data integrity and security, the User Registration Script includes data validation and error handling. This safeguards our system against potential issues like SQL injection and inaccurate data.

- **Account Creation:** The script inserts the processed user data into the database, effectively creating new user accounts. This is an essential step in allowing users to access our platform.

- **Feedback to Users:** Upon successful registration, the script provides feedback to users, confirming their registration. In case of any issues, appropriate error messages are displayed.

# User Login Script

The User Login Script is designed to handle user login and authentication. It validates user login credentials against a database and provides login feedback.
## Usage

To use the User Login Script, follow these steps:

1. **Customize Database Connection**: Open the User Login Script and customize the database connection parameters (`$host`, `$user`, `$pass`, `$dbname`) to match your specific database configuration.

2. **Create an HTML Login Form**: Ensure that you have an HTML login form within your project. This form should collect user input for email and password. Set the `action` attribute of the form tag to point to the User Login Script. For example:
